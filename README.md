This is a generic path tracer modeled after Peter Shirley's "Ray-Tracing in a Weekend" [book](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

### Showcase
There are some interesting renders each with 100 SPP  
My path tracer emits PPM files, for each image, I added a viewable PNG copy.
